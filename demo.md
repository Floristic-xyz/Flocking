**User Flow Walkthrough**

We created a video that takes you step-by-step through our mockup, showcasing the user flow. In this walkthrough, you’ll see both functional features and placeholders, giving you a clear idea of how Flocking operates and what the final product will look like. This video demonstrates the user journey from connecting a wallet to exploring insights, making decisions, and collecting NFTs.

In our second video, we dive into the technical aspects of Flocking. We cover the tech stack choices, API integrations, and the coding process. This video includes live code demonstrations, providing an in-depth look at how we built and implemented key features. It's a great resource for understanding the backend work and the thought process behind our development.
